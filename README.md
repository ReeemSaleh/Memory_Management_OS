# ðŸ’¾ Memory Management Simulator for Operating Systems

Memory management is a fundamental component of modern operating systems, responsible for efficiently handling how memory is allocated, accessed, and managed by applications and processes. It ensures that critical data and instructions are readily available to the system when needed, maximizing both performance and resource utilization.

This project simulates two key types of memory:

- **Main Memory (RAM):**  
  A volatile storage used to temporarily hold active processes, data, and instructions. It requires power to retain its contents and provides fast access for the CPU.

- **Virtual Memory:**  
  An extension of main memory that uses secondary storage (typically a hard disk or SSD) to simulate additional RAM. It allows systems to handle larger applications or multiple programs simultaneously by swapping data in and out of main memory.

Virtual memory also provides protection by isolating memory used by different processes and helps prevent data loss in case of system failures.
